This is the weather app used to show accurate weather with the open weather API.

1. First, we will create a constant object variable, which will store our object base and key values.

2. Then, by using document.queryselector, We will select our input search box, and we will add a Keypress event listener to it, which we will attach to a function called setQuery.

3. Create another function that fetches the weather details using the API, and then it will return the weather details using the json() method.

4. Then create a function that will push all the output into our HTML element so that we can display the weather details on our webpage.

5. Now we can also create the function by which we will fetch the current date and year from the user’s browser.

5.1. Now inside that, we will create an array for the months in a year.

5.2. A week’s worth of days in an array

5.3. Now using the.getDay and date() methods, we will fetch the current date and store it into the variables, and using those variables, we will display it as our output.
